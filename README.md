# FileReader
A Simple, Probably Buggy Program For Editing, Saving, And Opening Text, Python, Java, And C# Files. (WARNING: Cannot See Syntax Yet! I'm Working On It!) PS: You DO Need Python Installed To Run This. 
Might Add Python Into the Files So You Get It When You Download The Application. Do NOT Download The Release! That Will Only Download A Non-Python File! I Don't Know How To Fix That.. 
Instead, Click The Green "Code" Button And Get The Zip File There.
